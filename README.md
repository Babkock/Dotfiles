# Dotfiles

My personal configuration files for various GNU/Linux programs. These were tested on multiple distros. The ["pi" branch](https://github.com/Babkock/Dotfiles/tree/pi) is my ongoing set of Raspberry Pi config files.

# fetch

This repository includes a [Dotfiles fetcher script](https://github.com/Babkock/Dotfiles/tree/master/fetch) that I use to retrieve my configuration files
quickly. It revolves around two parallel arrays of file paths.

# 'halp' man page

I have congregated several programs' worth of keybindings and shell aliases
into a nicely-formatted [man page](https://github.com/Babkock/Dotfiles/tree/master/halp.1) for quick reference.
