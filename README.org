Welcome to my Dotfiles. This repository contains my personal configuration files for various
GNU/Linux programs. You can view the configurations that are literate/self-documenting [[https://babkock.github.io/][on my GitHub Pages]] - and these can be
tangled via Emacs Org mode. [[https://gitlab.com/Babkock/Dotfiles][This repository is mirrored here, on GitLab.]] This repository is old, from 2019, when I knew less about Linux,
so cloning may take a while as it is large and has many pictures. Try cloning with =git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Babkock/Dotfiles.git=

** fetch

This collection includes my [[https://gitlab.com/Babkock/Dotfiles/-/blob/master/fetch.org][Dotfiles fetcher script]] which retrieves the most current
configuration files from their specific spots on the system, overwrites their copies in
this repo, and adds them to the Git staging area. I rely on this script for almost all of my commits.
