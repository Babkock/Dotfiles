Welcome to my Dotfiles. This repository contains my personal configuration files for various
GNU/Linux programs. You can view the configurations that are literate/self-documenting [[https://babkock.github.io/][on my GitHub Pages]] - and these can be
tangled via Emacs Org mode. [[https://gitlab.com/Babkock/Dotfiles][This repository is mirrored here, on GitLab.]] This repository is old, from 2019, when I knew less about Linux,
so cloning may take a while as it is large and has many pictures. Try cloning with =git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Babkock/Dotfiles.git=

** fetch

This collection includes my [[https://github.com/Babkock/Dotfiles/blob/master/fetch.org][Dotfiles fetcher script]] which retrieves the most current
configuration files from their specific spots on the system, overwrites their copies in
this repo, and adds them to the Git staging area. I rely on this script for almost all of my commits.

** Wayland Desktop Environments

This repository includes startup scripts and configurations to launch four unique full-featured environments in four different Wayland compositors. *SwayFX*, *Wayfire*, *Hyprland*, and *Niri*. Each of these sessions include their own independent "rices", or color schemes, and configurations for Waybar, Foot or Alacritty, Mako, and Wob. There are shell functions to launch each of these desktop environments in my [[https://github.com/Babkock/Dotfiles/blob/master/zsh/README.org][Zsh config]]. Wallpapers not included, but you can find them in my [[https://gitlab.com/Babkock/wallpapers][wallpapers]] repository.

* Other Orgs

An Org document is a literate configuration file (or a simple to-do list, or a poem, or a story) written in Emacs Org mode. Emacs is able to "tangle" the code blocks in an Org document to
their respective configuration files. You can view these Org documents as web pages on my [[https://babkock.github.io/][GitHub Pages]] web site, and see the source code in [[https://github.com/Babkock/babkock.github.io][its repository]].
