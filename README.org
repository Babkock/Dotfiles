Welcome to my Dotfiles. This repository contains my personal configuration files for various
GNU/Linux programs. You can view the configurations that are literate/self-documenting [[https://babkock.github.io/][on my GitHub Pages]] - and these can be
tangled via Emacs Org mode. This repository is old, from 2019, when I knew less about Linux,
so cloning may take a while as it is large and has many pictures. Try cloning with =git clone --depth 1 git@gitlab.com:Babkock/Dotfiles.git=

** fetch

This collection includes my [[https://gitlab.com/Babkock/Dotfiles/-/blob/master/fetch.org][Dotfiles fetcher script]] which retrieves the most current
configuration files from their specific spots on the system, overwrites their copies in
this repo, and adds them to the Git staging area. I rely on this script for almost all of my commits.

* Programs Included

The most commonly updated files in this collection are: my Emacs configuration; my Qutebrowser configuration, rice, and start page; my general
rice/color scheme defined in [[https://github.com/Babkock/Dotfiles/blob/master/Xresources][Xresources]], [[https://github.com/Babkock/Dotfiles/blob/master/bspwm/README.org][Bspwmrc]], and Polybar; and my [[https://github.com/Babkock/Dotfiles/blob/master/zshrc][Zshrc]]. I do not use a display manager, so I use [[https://github.com/Babkock/Dotfiles/blob/master/xinitrc][xinitrc]].

This repository has configuration files for three different Wayland compositors: [[https://github.com/swaywm/sway][Sway]], [[https://github.com/riverwm/river][river]], and [[https://github.com/labwc/labwc][LabWC]]. Each of these compositors are a
self-contained environment, they each have their own Waybar, Foot, Swaylock, and Wob configurations, and their own color schemes.
They are launched with scripts in the [[https://github.com/Babkock/Dotfiles/tree/master/bin][bin]] directory, and their autostart files load their respective configurations.

Various desktop screenshots I've collected over the years. My rice game is so much
better now!
